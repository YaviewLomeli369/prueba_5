# Overview

This is a modular web application system built with React and Express.js that provides a configurable platform for creating complete websites. The system features a modern tech stack with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components on the frontend, paired with an Express.js backend using in-memory storage for development. The application supports multiple user roles (superuser, admin, staff, cliente) and includes modules for testimonials, FAQs, contact management, blog, e-commerce store functionality, and reservations. The system is designed to be highly configurable through JSON-based site configuration, allowing administrators to enable/disable modules and customize content dynamically.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React with TypeScript and wouter for client-side routing. The UI layer leverages shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS for consistent design. State management is handled through TanStack Query for server state and React hooks for local state. The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between public pages, admin pages, and reusable UI components.

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript. The server implements a modular routing system with authentication middleware and role-based access control. Session management is handled through a simple in-memory store for demo purposes, with plans for more robust solutions in production. The API layer includes comprehensive CRUD operations for all data entities and follows consistent error handling patterns.

## Database Design
The system uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The schema is designed with modularity in mind, featuring separate tables for users, site configuration, testimonials, FAQs, contact information, products, orders, and reservations. The site configuration uses JSONB storage for flexible, schema-less configuration data, allowing dynamic module settings without database migrations.

## Authentication & Authorization
Authentication is implemented using bearer token-based sessions with role-based access control. The system supports four user roles: superuser (full access), admin (management access), staff (limited admin), and cliente (customer access). Authorization is enforced at both the API route level and frontend component level, with protected routes redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

## Module System
The application implements a modular architecture where different business features (testimonials, FAQs, store, reservations, contact) can be enabled or disabled through configuration. Each module is self-contained with its own database schema, API endpoints, frontend components, and admin interface. This allows for easy customization and deployment of only required features.
